Notes
-----

There is one Makefile (hack from SilentMakefile) which does not need
any setup.

Using your own Makefile
-----------------------

In order to run LaTeX, you need to add "data" folder into the search path of
pdflatex.  If you use Makefile's, add this line:

	export TEXINPUTS=$(shell kpsepath tex):$(shell pwd)/data/

Also the graphs are plotted using `gnuplot`.  You need to enable the execution
of shell commands by passing `-shell-escape` to pdflatex:

	pdflatex -shell-escape


Warning
-------

gnuplot created files with .table extension.  On the repository's Makefile
all files matching *.table will be deleted on cleaning section.
